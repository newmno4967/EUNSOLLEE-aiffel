forces you can t control you ever been in a war councilman in a firefight did you feel an over abundance of control you saying that this asgard has declared war on our planet not asgard loki he can t be working alone what about the other one his brother our intelligence says thor is not a hostile but he s worlds away we can t depend on him to help either it s up to us which is why you should be focusing on phase 2 it was designed for exactly phase 2 isn t ready our enemy is we need a response team the avengers initiative was shut down this isn t about the avengers we have seen the list we re running the world s greatest covert security network and you re gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks i m not leaving anything to anyone we need a response team these people may be isolated unbalanced even but i believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need you believe war isn t won by sentiment director no it s won by soldiers there s not enough time i m gotta pull into the water you wont be alone oh god this guy is still alive trouble sleeping i slept for 70 years sir i think i ve had my fill then you should be out celebrating seeing the world i went under the world was at war i wake up they say we won they didn t say what we lost we ve made some mistakes along the way some very recently you here with a mission sir i am trying to get me back in the world trying to save it hydra s secret weapon howard stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you he thought what we think the tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy that s something the world sorely needs who took it from you he s called loki he s not from around here there s a lot we ll have to bring you up to speed on if you re in the world has gotten even stranger than you already know at this point i doubt anything would surprise me ten bucks says you re wrong there s a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment is there anything you can tell us about the tesseract that we ought to know now you should have left it in the ocean you re good to go on this end the rest is up to you you disconnected the transition lines are we off the grid stark towers is about to become a beacon of self sustaining clean energy wow so maybe our reactor takes over and it actually works i assume light her up how does it look like christmas but with more me gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign you need to do some press i can do some more tomorrow i m working on the zoning for the next billboards pepper you re killing me remember enjoy the moment i remember sir agent coulson of shield is on the line i m not in i m actually out sir i m afraid he s insisting close the line jarvis i got a date levels are holding steady i think of course they are i was directly involved which brings me to my next question how does it feel to be a genius well ha i really wouldn t know now would i what do you mean all this came from you no all this came from that give yourself some credit please stark tower stark tower is your baby give yourself twelve percent of the credit twelve percent an argument can be made for fifteen twelve percent for my baby well i did do all the heavy lifting literally i lifted the heavy things and sorry but the security snafu that was on you my private elevator you mean our elevator it was teeming with sweaty workmen i m going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later on aren t i not gonna be that subtle i ll tell you what next building is gonna say potts on the tower on the lease call your mom can you bunk over sir the telephone i m afraid my protocol s are being overwritten stark we need to talk you have reached the life model decoy of tony stark please leave a message this is urgent then leave it urgently security breach that s on you mr stark phil come in phil i can t stay uh his first name is agent come on in we re celebrating which is why he can t stay soon as possible i don t like being handed things that s alright cause i love to be handed things so let s trade thank you official consulting hours are between eight and five every other thursday this isn t a consultation is this about the avengers which i i know nothing about the avengers initiative was scrapped i thought and i didn t even qualify i didn t know that either yeah apparently i m volatile self obsessed don t play well with others that i did know this isn t about personality profiles anymore whatever miss potts got a sec you know i thought we were having a moment i was having twelve

lot of people were you were the world s first superhero banner thought gammer radiation might hold the key to unlocking erskine s original formula didn t really go his way did it not so much when he s got that thing though guy s like a stephen hawking he s like a smart person i gotta say it s an honor to meet you officially i sort of met you i mean i watched you while you were sleeping i mean i was i was present while you were unconscious from the ice you know it s really it s just a just a huge honor to have you on board well i hope i m the man for the job oh you are absolutely uh we ve made some modifications to the uniform i had a little design input the uniform aren t the stars and stripes a little old fashioned everything that s happening the things that are about to come to light people might just need a little old fashioned the chitauri grow restless let them grow restless i will lead them in the glorious battle battle against a meagre might of earth glorious not lengthy if your force is as formidable as you claim you question us question him he who put the scepter in your hand who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out defeated i was a king the rightful king of asgard betrayed your ambition is little and full of childish need we look beyond the earth to great worlds the tesseract will avail you don t have the tesseract yet i don t threaten but until i open the doors until your force is mine to command you are the wars you will have your war as guardian if you fail if the tesseract is kept from us there will be no realm no barren moon no crevasse where i can t find you you think you know pain you will receive something sweet as pain get your captain equipment all right agent romanoff he s captain rogers they need you on the bridge see you there there was quite the buzz around here finding you in the ice i thought coulson was gonna swoon did he ask you to sign his captain america trading cards yet trading cards they re vintage he s very proud dr banner oh yeah hi they told me you d be coming word is you can find the cube is that the only word on me only word i care about must be strange for you all of this well this is actually kind of familiar gentlemen you may wanna step inside in a minute it s gonna get a little hard to breath is this is a submarine really they wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container oh no this is much worse all engine operating sheild emergency protocol 1 9 3 6 in effect we re in sir good lets vanish engage retro reflection panels reflection panels engaged gentlemen doctor thank you for coming thanks for asking nicely so uh how long am i staying once we get our hands on the tesseract you re in the clear where are you with that we re sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet cell phones laptops if it s connected to a satellite it s eyes and ears for us that s still not gonna find them in time you have to narrow the field how many spectrometers do you have access to how many are there call every lab you know tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays i ll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition at least we could rule out a few places do you have somewhere for me to work agent romanoff would you show dr banner to his laboratory please you re gonna love it doc we got all the toys put over there is this the stuff you need yeah iridium it s found in meteorites it forms anti protons it s very hard to get hold of specially if shield knows you need it well i didn t know the tesseract is showing me so much it s it s more than knowledge it s truth i know what did it show you agent barton my next target tell me what you need i need a distraction and an eyeball i mean if it s not too much trouble no no it s fine it s a vintage set it took me a couple of years to collect them all near mint slight foxing around the edges but we got a hit sixty seven percent match weight cross match seventy nine percent location stuttgart germany 28 canning strasse he s not exactly hiding captain you re up kneel before me i said kneel is not this simpler is this not your natural state it s the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation the bright lure of freedom diminishes your life s joy in a mad scramble for power and identity you were made to be ruled in the end you will always kneel not to men like you there are no men like me there are always men like you look to your elder people let him be an example you know the last time i was in germany and saw a man standing above everybody else we ended up disagreeing i m not the one who s out of time loki drop the weapon and stand down kneel not today the guy s all over the place agent romanoff did you miss me make your move reindeer names good move mr stark captain didn t he say anything not a word just get in here we re low on time i don t like it what rock of ages giving up so easily i don t remember it being that easy this guy packs a wallop still you were pretty spry for an older fellow what s your thing pilates what it s like calisthenics you might have missed a couple things you know doing time as a capsicle fury didn t tell me he was calling you in yeah there s a lot of things fury doesn t tell you where s this coming from what s the matter scared of a little lightning i m not overly fond of what follows now there s that guy another asgardian think the guy s a friendly doesn t matter if he frees loki or kills him the tesseract s lost stark we need a plan of attack i have a plan attack i d sit this one out cap i don t see how i can these guys come from legends they re basically gods there s only one god ma am and i m pretty sure he doesn t dress like that where s the tesseract i missed you too do i look to be in a gaming mood oh you should thank me with the bifrost gone how much dark energy did the all father have to muster to conjure you here your precious earth i thought you dead did you mourn we all did our father your father he did tell you my true parentage did he not we were raised together we played together we fought together do you remember none of that i remember a shadows living in the shade of your greatness i remember you tossing me into an abyss i who was and should be king so you take the world i love as recompense for your imagined slights no the earth is under my protection loki and you re doing a marvelous job with that the humans slaughter each other in droves while you ideally threat i mean to rule them that s why should i not think yourself above them well yes then you miss the truth of ruling brother a throne would suit you ill i ve seen worlds you ve never known about i have grown odin s son in my exile i have seen the true power of the tesseract and when i wield it who showed you this power who controls the would be king i am the king not here you give up the tesseract you give up this poisonous dream you come home i do not have it you need the cube to bring me home but i ve sent it off i know not where you listen well brother i m listening do not touch me again then don t take my stuff you have no idea what you re dealing with uh shakespeare in the park doth mother know you weareth her drapes this is beyond you metal man loki will face asgardian justice he gives up the cube and he s all yours until then stay out of the way tourist okay how about that thats enough now i don t know what you plan on doing here i ve come here to put and end to loki s schemes then prove it put that hammer down uh yep no bad call he loves his hammer you want me to put the hammer down are we done here in case it s unclear you try to escape you so much as scratch that glass thirty thousand feet straight down in a steel trap you get how that works ant boot it s an impressive cage not built i think for me built for something a lot stronger than you oh i ve heard the mindless beast makes play to be the man how desperate are you you call on these lost creatures to defend you how desperate am i you threaten my world with war you steal a force you can t hope to control you talk about peace and you kill cause it s fun you have made me very desperate you might not be glad that you did ooh it burns you to come so close to have the tesseract to have power unlimited power and for what a world for all mankind to share and then to be reminded what real power is well let me know if real power will want some magazine or something he really grows on you doesn t he loki s gonna drag this out so thor what s his play he has an army called the chitauri that none of asgard nor any world know he means to lead them against your people they will win him the earth return i suspect for the tesseract an army from outer space so he s building another portal that s what he needs erik selvig for selvig he s an astrophysicist he s a friend loki has him under some kind of spell along with one of ours i wanna know why loki let us take him he s not leading an army from here i don t think we should be focusing on loki that guy s brain is a bag full of cats you could smell crazy on him i don t care how you speak loki is beyond reason but he is of asgard and he s my brother he killed eighty people in two days he s adopted i think its about the mechanics iridium what did they need the iridium for it s a stabilizing agent means the portal won t collapse on itself like it did at shield no hard feelings point break you ve got a mean swing also it means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as loki wants that man is playing gallaga thought we wouldn t notice but we did how does fury even see these he turns sounds exhausting the rest of the raw materials agent barton can get his hands on pretty easily only major component he still needs is a power source a high energy density something to kick start the cube when did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics last night the packet selvig s notes the extraction theory papers am i the only one who did the reading does loki need any particular kind of power source he got to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the coulomb barrier unless selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunnelling effect well if he could do that he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet finally someone who speaks english is that what just happened it s good to meet you dr banner you re work on anti electron collisions is unparalleled and i m a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster thanks dr banner is only here to track the cube i was hoping you might join him let s start with that stick of his it may be magical but it works an awful lot like a hydra weapon i don t know about that but it is powered by the cube and i d like to know how loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men i know into his personal flying monkeys monkeys i do not understand i do i understood that reference shall we play it doctor this way sir the gamma readings are definitely consistent with selvig s reports on the tesseract but it s gonna take weeks to process if we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the homer cluster we can clock this around six hundred teraflops all i packed was a tooth brush you know you should come by stark towers sometime top ten floors all r and d you d love it it s candy land thanks but the last time i was in new york i kind of broke harlem well i promise a stress free environment no tension no surprises nothing are you nuts you really have got a lid on it haven t you what s your secret mellow jazz bongo drums huge bag of weed is everything a joke to you threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn t funny no offense doctor no it it s alright i wouldn t have come aboard if i couldn t handle pointy things you re tiptoeing big man you need to strut and you need to focus on the problem mr stark you think i m not why did fury call us and why now why not before what isn t he telling us i can t do the equation unless i have all the variables you think fury s hiding something he is a spy he s a spy captain he s the spy his secrets have secrets it s bugging him too isn t it uh i just wanna finish my work here and doctor a world for all mankind loki s jab at fury about the cube i heard it well i think that was meant for you even if barton didn t post that all over the news the stark tower that big ugly building in new york it s powered by stark reactors self sustaining energy source that building will run itself for what a year that s just the prototype i m kind of the only name in clean energy right now so why didn t shield bring him in on the tesseract project i mean what are they doing in the energy business in the first place i should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of shield s secure files i m sorry did you say jarvis has been running it since i hit the bridge in a few hours we ll know every dirty secret shield has ever tried to hide blueberry yet you re confused about why they didn t want you around an intelligence organization that fears intelligence historically not possible i think loki s trying to wind us up this is a man who means to start a war and if don t stay focused he ll succeed we have orders we should follow them following is not really my style and you re all about style aren t you of the people in this room which one is a wearing a spangly outfit and b not of use steve tell me none of this smells a little funky to you just find the cube that s the guy my dad never shut up about wondering if they shouldn t have kept him on ice the guy s not wrong about loki he does have the jump on us what he s got is an acme dynamite kit it s gonna blow up in his face and i m gonna be there when it does and i ll read all about it or you ll be suiting up like the rest of us ah see i don t get a suit of armor i m exposed like a nerve it s a nightmare you know i ve got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second to crawl its way into my heart this stops it this little circle of light it s part of me now not just armor it s a terrible privilege but you can control it because i learned how it s different hey i ve read all about your accident that much gammer exposure should have killed you so you re saying that the hulk the other guy saved my life that s nice it s a nice sentiment save it for what i guess we ll find out you may not enjoy that you just might as soon as loki took the doctor we moved jane foster we ve got an excellent observatory in traunsee she was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday handsome fee private plane very remote she ll be safe thank you it s no accident loki taking erik selvig i dread what he plans for him once he s done erik is a good man he talks about you a lot you changed his life you changed everything around here they were better as they were we pretend on asgard that we re more advanced but we we come here battling like bilchsteim like what bilchsteim you know huge scaly big antlers you don t have those i don t think so they are repulsive and they trample everything in their path when i first came to earth loki s rage followed me here and your people paid the price and now again n my youth i courted war war hasn t started yet you think you can make loki tell us what the tesseract is i do not know loki s mind is far afield it s not just power he craves it s vengeance upon me there s no pain that would prise his need from him a lot of guys think that until the pain stops what are you asking me to do i m asking what are you prepared to do loki is a prisoner then why do i feel like he s the only person on this boat that wants to be here there s not many people that can sneak up on me but you figured i d come after after whatever tortures fury can concoct you would appear as a friend as a balm and i would cooperate i wanna know what you ve done to agent barton i d say i ve expanded his mind and once you ve won once you re king of the mountain what happens to his mind is this love agent romanoff love is for children i owe him a debt tell me before i worked for shield i i made a name for myself i have a very specific skillset i didn t care who i used it for or on i got on shield s radar in a bad way agent barton was sent to kill me he made a different call and what will you do if i vow to spare him i ll not let you out ah no but i like this your world in the balance and you bargain for one man regime s fall everyday i tend not to weep over that i m russian or i was and what are you now it s really not that complicated i ve got red in my ledger i d like to wipe it out can you can you wipe out that much red drakoff s daughter sao paulo the hospital file barton told me everything your ledger is dripping it s gushing red and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything this is the basest sentimentality this is a child at prayer pathetic you lie and kill in the service of liars and killers you pretend to be separate to have your own code something that makes up for the horrors but they are a part of you and they will never go away i won t barter barton not until i make him kill you slowly intimately in every way he knows you fear and then he ll wake just long enough to see his good work and when he screams i ll split his skull this is my bargain you mewling quin you re a monster oh no you brought the monster so banner that s your play what loki means to unleash the hulk keep banner in the lab i m on my way set the door locked thank you for your cooperation what are you doing mr stark kind of been wondering the same thing about you you re supposed to be locating the tesseract we are the model s locked and we re sweeping for the signature now when we get a hit we ll have the location within half a mile and you ll get your cube back no muss no fuss what is phase 2 phase 2 is shield used the cube to make weapons sorry the computer was moving a little slow for me rogers we gathered everything related to the tesseract this does not mean that we re i m sorry nick what were you lying i was wrong director the world hasn t changed a bit do you know about this you wanna think about removing yourself from this environment doctor i was in calcutta i was pretty well removed loki s manipulating you and you ve been doing what exactly you didn t come here because i bat my eyelashes at you yes and i m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy i d like to know why shield is using the tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction because of him me last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge mass that levelled a small town we learned that not only are we not alone but we are hopelessly hilariously out gunned my people want nothing but peace with your planet but you re not the only people out there are you and you re not the only threat the world s filling up with people who can t be matched they can t be controlled like you controlled the cube you re work with the tesseract is what drew loki to it and his allies it is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war a higher form you forced our hand we had to come up with something a nuclear deterrent cause that always calms everything right down remind me again how you made your fortune stark i m sure if he still made weapons stark would be neck deep wait wait hold on how is this now about me i m sorry isn t everything i thought humans were more evolved than this excuse me did we come to your planet and blow stuff up we can you speak of control yet you court chaos it s his m o isn t it i mean what are we a team no no no we re a chemical mixture that makes chaos we re we re a time bomb you need to step away why shouldn t they guy let off a little steam you know damn well why back off oh i m starting to want you to make me yeah big man in a suit of armor take that off what are you genius billionaire playboy philanthropist i know guys with none of that worth ten of you i ve seen the footage the only thing you really fight for is yourself you re not the guy to make the sacrifice play to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you i think i would just cut the wire always a way out you know you may not be a threat but you better stop pretending to be a hero a hero like you you re a laboratory experiment rogers everything special about you came out of a bottle put on the suite let s go a few rounds you people are so petty and tiny yes right agent romanoff would you escort dr banner back to his where you re renting my room the cell was just in case you needed to kill me but you can t i know i tried i got low i didn t see an end so i put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out so i moved on i focused on helping other people i was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk you wanna know my secret agent romanoff you wanna know how i stay calm dr banner put down the scepter all right sorry kids you don t get to see my party trick after all located the tesseract i can get there faster the tesseract belongs on asgard no human is a match for it you re not going alone you gonna stop me put on the suit let s find out i m not afraid to hit an old man put on the suit oh my god put on the suit yep hill its a detonation number three engines is down we re been hit fire engines talk to me turbine looks mostly intact but it is impossible to get out there and repair when we already there if we lose one of engine we wont be someone gonna get outside and patch the engine stark did you capy that i m on it okay you okay right keep that engine down attention wait the cameras going dark stay close level four engine three i ll meet you there doctor bruce you gotta fight this is just what loki wants we re gonna be okay listen to me we re gonna be okay right i swear on my life i will get you out of this you will walk away and never your life bruce we have been carrying 180 to the south takes us to the water free wind navigation recalibration after the engine failure is the sun coming up yes sir then put it on the left takes us on the water one more turbine goes down we re trapped stark stark i m here good see what we got i gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before i can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris i need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position what s it look like in there it seems to run on some form of electricity well you re not wrong we re not your enemies banner try to think the relays are intact what s our next move even if i clear the rotors this thing won t re engage without a jump i m gonna have to get in there and push well if that thing gets up to speed you ll get shredded then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag speak english see that red lever it ll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out stand by it wait for my word i need full evac on lower deck grenade we gotta perimeter breach hostile wiped shield gear hulk and thor are in the research level sir the hulk will tear this place apart get his attention escorts six o proceed to the don t get too close target acquired target engaged target in moving engine now all shut down sir we lost all engine one it s barton he took out our system he s headed for the detention lab does anybody copy this is agent romanoff i copy stark we losing altitude i have noticed no are you ever not going to fall for that the humans think us immortal should we test that move away please do you like this we started working on the prototype after you sent the destroyer even i don t know what it does do you wanna find out no natasha you re gonna lose am i it s in your nature you re heroes are scattered your floating fortress falls from the sky where is my disadvantage your lack conviction i don t think i so that s what it does cap need a lever i need a minute here lever now i m sorry boss they got rabbited just stay awake eyes on me no i m clockin out here not an option it s okay boss this was never gonna work if they didn t have something to agent coulson is down the medical team on the way to the location they re here these were in phil coulson s jacket guess he never did get you to sign them we re dead in the air up here our communications location of the cube banner thor i got nothing for you lost my one good eye maybe i had that coming yes we were going to build an arsenal with the tesseract i never put all my chips on that number though because i was playing something even riskier there was an idea stark knows this called the avengers initiative the idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people see if they could become something more see if they could work together when we needed them to to fight the battles that we never could phil coulson died still believing in that idea in heroes well it s an old fashioned notion you fell out of the sky did i hurt anybody there s nobody around here to get hurt you did scare the hell out of some pigeons though lucky or just good aim you were awake when you fell you saw the whole thing right through the ceiling big and green and buck ass nude here i didn t think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella thank you are you an alien what from outer space an alien no well then son you ve got a condition clint you re gonna be alright you know that is that what you know i got i gotta go in though i gotta flush him out we don t have that long it s gonna take time i don t understand have you ever had someone take your brain and play pull you out and send something else in do you know what it s like to be unmade you know that i do why am i back how did you get him out cognitive recalibration i hit you really hard in the head thanks natasha how many agents don t don t do that to yourself clint this is loki this is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for loki he got away yeah i don t suppose you know where i didn t need to know i didn t ask he s gonna make his play soon though today we gotta stop him yeah who s we i don t know who s ever left well if i put an arrow in loki s eye socket i d sleep better i suppose now you sound like you but you don t you re a spy not a soldier now you want to wade into a war why what did loki do to you he didn t i just natasha i ve been compromised i got red in my ledger i d like to wipe it out was he married no he was a cellist i think i m sorry he seemed like a good man he was an idiot why for believing for taking on loki alone he was doing his job he was out of his league he should have waited he should have sometimes there isn t a way out tony right how did that work for him is this the first time you ve lost a soldier we re not soldiers i m not marching to fury s fife neither am i he s got the same blood on his hands that loki does but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done now loki needs a power source if we can put together a list he made it personal that s not the point that is the point that s loki s point he hit us all right where we live why to tear us apart he had to conquer his greed but he knows he has to take us out to win right that s what he wants he wants to beat us he wants to be seen doing it he wants an audience right i caught his act in stuttgart yeah that s just previews this is this is opening night and loki he s a full tail diva he wants flowers he wants parades he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered i hope that would be true time to go go where i ll tell you on the way can you fly one of those jets i can you got a suit yeah then suit up you guys aren t authorized to be in here son just don t sir done is jacket ranugal ranugal they needed to push they found it get our communications back up whatever you have to do i want eyes on everything yes sir this device has already self sustainig shut it down dr selvig it s too late it can t stop now he wants to show us something a new universe okay the barrier is pure energy it s unbreachable yeah i get that plan b sir mark 7 is not ready for deployment then skip the spinning ring we re run out of clock please tell me you re going to appeal to my humanity uh actually i m planning to threaten you should have left your armor on for that yeah it s seen a bit of mileage you ve got the blue stick of destiny stalling me won t change anything no no no threatening the chitauri are coming nothing will change that what have i to fear the avengers it s what we call ourselves sort of like a team earth s mightiest heroes type of thing yes i ve met them yeah takes us a while to get any traction i ll give you that one but let s do a head count here your brother the demi god a super soldier a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend a man with breath taking anger management issues a couple of master assassins and you big fella you ve managed to piss off every single one of them that was the plan not a great plan when they come and they will they ll come for you i have an army we have a hulk i thought the beast had wandered off you re missing the point there s no throne there is no version of this where you come out on top maybe your army comes and maybe it s too much for us but it s all on you because if we can t protect the earth you can be damned well sure we ll avenge it how will your friends have time for me when they re so busy fighting you it should work well performance issues you know jarvis anytime now you will all fall before me and there s one other person you pissed off his name is phil right army loki turn off the tesseract or i ll destroy it you can t there is no stopping it there is only the war so be it stark we re heading north east what did you stop for drive through swing that park i m gonna lay them out for you so we have more incoming lets keep them occupied nat did you see them we need back up there stark are you seeing this i m seeing still working on believing where s banner has he shown up yet banner just keep me posted jarvis find me a soft spot look at this look around you you think this madness will end with your rule it s too late it s too late to stop it no we can together sentiment you got civilian trap in the roof loki there more down there we got this go go you think you can hold them
